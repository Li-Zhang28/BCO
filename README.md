# BCO
Develop
BCO (Bayesian Compositional models for analyzing Ordinal response) was developed to analyze the relationship between compositional data and an ordinal response with a soft restriction on sum of variable coefficients through the prior on coefficients. This package provides simulation code and real dataset.

# Installation
Please download the packge to your computer and put it in a workpath that your Rstudio can access to it. The codes are developped under R version 4.0.5.

This package includes 2 folders: Simulation and Real data. We introduce each of these as follows.

# Simulation
In this directory, you will find two main files: "simulation" and "analysis".
- The "simulation" file contains the code for data simulation, allowing you to generate synthetic data for testing and validation purposes.

- The "analysis" file contains the analysis code for our proposed method BCO. 

# Real data
In this directory, you will find three main subfolders: "data" and "analysis".
- The "data" folder contains the real dataset.

- The "analysis" file contains the analysis code for our proposed method BCO.
